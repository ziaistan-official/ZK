## Keyboard Layouts Documentation

This document provides an overview of the modifications made to the English QWERTY and Urdu Phonetic keyboard layouts. These changes are designed to enhance the typing experience by providing quick access to a wide range of functions, symbols, and diacritics.

### English QWERTY Layout (`latn_qwerty_us.xml`)

The English QWERTY layout has been significantly enhanced to provide a more powerful and efficient typing experience.

#### Key Modifications:

*   **Custom Function Rows:** Two dedicated function rows have been added at the top of the keyboard, providing one-tap access to common actions such as:
    *   `home`, `end`, `page_up`, `page_down`
    *   `cut`, `copy`, `paste`, `selectAll`
    *   `undo`, `redo`, `delete`, `esc`
*   **Enhanced Modifier Keys:** The `shift` key now functions as a multi-modifier key, giving you access to `ctrl`, `alt`, and `meta` via corner swipes. It also includes integrated cursor controls.
*   **Comprehensive Fn Layer:** A powerful `Fn` layer has been added, providing quick access to a wide range of symbols, including:
    *   Punctuation: `۔`, `،`, `؟`, `!`, `(`, `)`, `"`, `'`
    *   Brackets: `[]`, `{}`
    *   Mathematical & Currency Symbols: `√`, `π`, `€`, `£`, `¥`
*   **Easy Symbol Access:** The main typing area now includes quick access to numbers and common symbols (e.g., `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`) through a long press or swipe up on the letter keys.

### Urdu Phonetic Layout (`urdu_phonetic_ur.xml`)

The Urdu Phonetic layout has been customized to provide a more intuitive and efficient typing experience for Urdu users.

#### Key Modifications:

*   **Diacritics on Every Key:** The most significant enhancement is the addition of diacritics (`zabbar`, `zer`, `pesh`, etc.) to every letter key via corner swipes. This allows for quick and easy access to correct Urdu spellings without needing a separate diacritics menu.
*   **Customized Fn Layer for Urdu:** The `Fn` layer has been tailored for Urdu users, providing quick access to:
    *   Urdu numerals: `۱`, `۲`, `۳`, etc.
    *   Urdu punctuation: `۔`, `،`, `؟`
    *   Common symbols and brackets.
*   **Consistent User Experience:** Like the English layout, the Urdu layout also includes two dedicated function rows with the same set of actions, ensuring a consistent and predictable experience when switching between languages.
*   **Enhanced Modifier Keys:** The `shift` key has the same multi-modifier and cursor control functionality as the English layout.

These modifications are designed to make the keyboard more powerful, versatile, and user-friendly for both English and Urdu typists.
